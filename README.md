# Beginner HTML (HyperText Markup Language) site scripted -- Adapted from MDN

In this assignment you will be working through a modified version of Mozilla Developer Network's *Getting Started with the Web* tutorial. There is a lot of really good material to go through (and revisit several times). I will outline what is required and what is optional but still recommended.

* [Getting started with the web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web) -- REQUIRED
  * [Installing basic software](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Installing_basic_software) -- OPTIONAL
  * [What will your website look like](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/What_will_your_website_look_like) -- OPTIONAL - useful if you are interested in web design
  * [Dealing with files](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Dealing_with_files) -- REQUIRED - you must know the typical files and file locations
  * [HTML basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics) -- REQUIRED - I encourage you to play with the examples as you read along. You can use the files in this repo or from the previous assignment to play and explore.
    * If there are terms you are not familiar with, click on the links to learn more.
    * ***At the end of this part you should have a completed `index.html` page.***
  * [CSS basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics) -- REQUIRED - CSS is how we make things pretty on the web. It can be fun, tedious, and powerful all at once.
    * If you didn't plan out the looks and colors, you may need to go back to the [What will your website look like](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/What_will_your_website_look_like) page.
    * ***At the end of this part you should have a completed `style.css` file and your `index.html` page should be styled accordingly.***
  * [Javascript basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics) -- REQUIRED
    * There is a lot of content here, especially if you have never programmed before. Be sure to take the time to (1) read, (2) try things out, (3) be curious about what works and what doesn't, (4) ask questions and look up other resources. You may not understand everything right away and that is ok.
    * ***At the end of this part you should have a completed `main.js` file and a webpage that behaves like the tutorial describes.***

***----Part One Modifications----***
1. *Use different images.* Use the UWL colors and logos to dress up the website. It is common for organizations to have specific colors, logos, and color schemes for their branding and identity. These are also often published for those interfacing with the company. Think about how branding of websites is used and how it communicates to you the identity of the organization.
    * [Main branding site](https://www.uwlax.edu/brand/)
    * [Design Architecture](https://www.uwlax.edu/brand/guides/design/architecture/)
    * [Design Colors](https://www.uwlax.edu/brand/guides/design/colors/)
    * [Design Fonts](https://www.uwlax.edu/brand/guides/design/fonts/)
    * [Design Icons](https://www.uwlax.edu/brand/guides/design/icons/)
2. *Use different colors and fonts as per the UWL style.*
3. *Use different text.*
    * Title in the page: FNT730 is cool, **user name**
    * First paragraph should say: "FinTech is:" followed by a list of at least 3 items in a bulleted list describing FinTech.
    * Second paragraph should describe what you are interested in learning about FinTech technologies this semester.
    * The third paragraph should be: "Please use the 'Change User' button to change the user and use the 'Add Value' button to add a value to the number displayed below."
    * Add the button "Add Value" and write the code to get a value from the user and add it to a variable called `currentVal`. Display `currentVal` using the same style as the title on the page, centered, and below the buttons. The initial value of `currentVal` should be 0, but it should accumulate each time the "Add Value" button is pressed. So, the initial value will be 0, if you then click "Add Value" and enter 5, then it should be 5. If you then click "Add Value" again and enter 7, it should display 12.

***-----------------------------***


* [Web Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API) -- REQUIRED - How, when, and where data is stored on the web is critical for understanding and building websites. You will also need to complete the activities within this section of the tutorial. You will find a copy of these websites in this repo that you can play with. Use the developer tools to observe how the web storage changes.
* [Publishing your website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Publishing_your_website) -- REQUIRED - while we won't be doing this in this assignment, you do need to know how web servers work and serve websites. You will also need to read the following links on how the web and internet works on this [webpage (click on all the links and read!)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Web_mechanics)
    * OPTIONAL - try publishing a website via GitHub Pages
* [How the Web works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works) -- REQUIRED - again, follow all the links if you haven't explored them already.
